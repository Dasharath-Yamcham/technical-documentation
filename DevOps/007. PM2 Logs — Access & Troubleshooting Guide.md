# 007.PM2 Logs — Access & Troubleshooting Guide (Simplified Version)

## 1. Overview

PM2 provides centralized logging for applications running across DEV, STAGE, and PROD environments. This document explains how to access, tail, and debug logs effectively.

## 2. Types of PM2 Logs

| Log Type          | Description                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Out Log (out.log) | Standard application logs (console output)    |
| Error Log (error.log) | Application errors, crashes, stack traces |
| PM2 Internal Log  | PM2-level events, restarts, failures          |

## 3. Check Running Applications

Before viewing logs, list all running services:

```bash
pm2 list
```

Identify the name or id of the service you want to debug.

## 4. Viewing Logs

### 4.1 View logs for a specific application

```bash
pm2 logs <app_name>
```

### 4.2 View only error logs

```bash
pm2 logs <app_name> --err
```

### 4.3 View only output logs

```bash
pm2 logs <app_name> --out
```

## 5. Tailing Logs (Live Streaming)

### 5.1 Tail logs in real time

```bash
pm2 logs <app_name> --lines 200
```

## 6. Direct File Access (Manual Log Checks)

PM2 stores raw log files here:

```plaintext
~/.pm2/logs/
```

Common files:

- `app-name-out.log`
- `app-name-error.log`

To read them:

```bash
cat ~/.pm2/logs/app-name-error.log
```

## 7. Identifying Issues

### 7.1 Application Crash

Look inside `error.log` for:

- Stack traces
- Runtime errors
- Memory issues
- Uncaught exceptions

### 7.2 Deployment or Environment Errors

Check for:

- Missing environment variables
- Failed DB/API connections
- Build errors during deployment

### 7.3 Frequent PM2 Restarts

If restart count keeps increasing:

```bash
pm2 list
```

Then read the error log for root cause.

## 8. Environment Usage (Simplified)

### DEV

- Most detailed logs
- Used for debugging during development
- Command:

```bash
pm2 logs <dev-app>
```

### STAGE

- Mirrors production
- Used for pre-release testing
- Command:

```bash
pm2 logs <stage-app>
```

### PROD

- Focus on error logs first
- Helps diagnose live application issues
- Command:

```bash
pm2 logs <prod-app>
