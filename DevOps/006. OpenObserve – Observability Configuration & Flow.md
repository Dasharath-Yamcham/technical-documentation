# 006.OpenObserve – Observability Configuration & Flow

## 1. Platform Overview

OpenObserve is deployed as the centralized observability platform for log aggregation, analysis, monitoring dashboards, and alerting. All application and system logs are forwarded to OpenObserve to enable real-time visibility and faster troubleshooting.

## 2. OpenObserve Access Details

| Parameter      | Value                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| OpenObserve URL| https://dev-openobserve.yodanotifications.com/  |
| Root User Email| teamdevops@labsquire.com                        |
| Authentication | Local OpenObserve Authentication                |

## 3. High-Level Log Flow

The following flow describes how logs move from applications to OpenObserve:

- Applications run under PM2 process manager
- PM2 captures stdout and stderr logs
- Log collection agents run on the same servers
- Agents parse and enrich logs with metadata
- Logs are securely forwarded to OpenObserve
- Logs are indexed and visualized using dashboards

## 5. Dashboards

Dashboards are used to visualize log data and monitor system health. They provide insights into application errors, PM2 process behavior, and infrastructure-level events.

- Application Logs Dashboard
- PM2 Process Monitoring Dashboard
- Infrastructure and System Logs Dashboard

## 6. Alerts & Monitoring

Alerts are configured to proactively notify teams about critical issues based on log patterns and system behavior.

- High application error rate alerts
- PM2 process crash or restart alerts
- Service inactivity or missing log alerts

## 7. Security & Best Practices

Access to OpenObserve is controlled using authentication and role-based access. Sensitive information should be filtered at the logging layer. Passwords and secrets must not be logged by applications.
